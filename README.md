## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Lars.

My interests lie in protein design, structural bioinformatics, and developing deep learning methods for molecular problems. I'm especially interested in integrating computational tools with experimental workflows to push the boundaries of biomolecular design.

ðŸ”­ I am currently a PhD student in the Biomolecular Design group at the Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry, advised by Lukas Milles and supported by Karsten Borgwardt.

ðŸŒ± I'm fascinated by the structure of proteins â€” how their form encodes function, how they navigate complex energy landscapes, and how deep learning might help us better understand and design them.
